# kotlin-anko-networking

A set of extension functions that use features from both [kotlin-anko](https://github.com/lightningkite/kotlin-anko) and [kotlin-networking](https://github.com/lightningkite/kotlin-networking).

Most of these functions involve bitmaps, as bitmaps are an Android specific class.
